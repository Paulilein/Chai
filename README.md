# Chai
This is a mock for connecting two different environments, one using python 
32bits (backend) and one using python 64bits (frontend using streamlit) using 
pickle to communicate between them. 

To initialize the project change the terminal working directory to 
`Chai-Frontend`, and write in the terminal:
```
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ streamlit run main.py
```
The first row activates the virtual environment of the frontend. The second 
row is used to initialize streamlit. (Note that this is only for Windows)
